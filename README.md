# Vehicular Automation Project

## Overview
The **Vehicular Automation Project** is designed to explore and develop automation solutions for vehicles. This project integrates communication protocols and machine learning algorithms to improve vehicular decision-making, efficiency, and safety.

## Features
- **Communication Protocol (`comm.c`)**:
  - Implements a framework for communication between vehicles and infrastructure.
  - Focuses on real-time, reliable data exchange.

- **Deep Neural Network (`dnn.py`)**:
  - Uses machine learning techniques for tasks like decision-making and route planning.
  - Aims to improve vehicle behavior in dynamic environments.

## Objectives
- Develop a scalable communication system for vehicular automation.
- Integrate machine learning to enhance autonomous vehicle functionalities.
- Enable seamless interaction between vehicles and infrastructure.

## Project Structure
The project includes the following components:
- **`comm.c`**: Implements communication protocols for data exchange.
- **`dnn.py`**: Integrates a deep learning-based decision-making system.
- **Documentation**: Contains reports and diagrams explaining the project design.

## Future Scope
- Expand the communication protocol to integrate real-time sensor data.
- Enhance the deep learning model with additional training datasets.
- Test the system in simulated environments to validate its robustness.
